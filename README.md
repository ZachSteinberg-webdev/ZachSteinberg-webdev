## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

I build responsive, user-friendly web apps using modern JavaScript tooling. I care a lot about clean UI, clear user flow, and making things feel good to interact with.

I started learning full-stack development after changing careers out of real estate. I‚Äôd always wanted to know how the web actually worked, and once I finally sat down and started building, I didn‚Äôt stop. Since then I‚Äôve designed and shipped multiple working apps from scratch (frontend, backend, data layer, deployment) and I‚Äôm actively looking for opportunities to keep doing this professionally.

I enjoy working on the frontend (TypeScript / JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind) and I also build and connect the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, auth with JWT / Passport.js / bcryptjs) so features actually work and persist. I like solving real problems, not just putting together pretty demos.

Outside of code, I‚Äôm usually on the trail backpacking with my wife, hunting for something good to eat around the Portland metro area, or drinking a not-too-hot cup of hot chocolate.

If you‚Äôre hiring for web dev or web-adjacent work and want someone who ships, reach out to me on LinkedIn or at zach@zachsteinberg.com.

## üë∑ Projects (live and deployed)

- Personal Portfolio Website - https://www.zachsteinberg.com  
  A responsive portfolio site built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS templates, and MongoDB/Mongoose. Includes a contact form with layered spam defense.   

- Get It Done! - https://www.get-it-done.app/  
  A responsive to-do list web app with a skeuomorphic interface and an embedded, movable basic-function calculator. Built for clarity and zero-friction daily use.  

- Game Box - https://www.game-box.app/  
  A collection of three mini-games running inside a custom fake desktop environment styled after early Aqua-era Mac OS X. Movable/resizable windows, a menu bar, a dock, a Force Quit menu, and more.  

- Did I Watch That?!?! - https://www.did-i-watch-that.app/

  A browser-based beat machine / drum pattern builder. Tap in patterns, layer sounds, adjust tempo, and save ideas you can come back to later. 

## üí° What‚Äôs next

I‚Äôm currently mulling over ideas for my next build. If you‚Äôve ever said ‚ÄúI wish there was a simple web app that could just ___,‚Äù tell me. I like turning that sentence into something real.

## üéì Still leveling up

- Going deeper on React patterns: state management, routing, data flow, performance
- Getting smoother with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS in production code
- Continuing to improve accessibility and real-world usability across devices (not just ‚Äúit runs on my machine‚Äù)
